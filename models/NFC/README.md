## [nfc_tag_chip_keyring.stl](nfc_tag_chip_keyring.stl)

This file is a model of a NFC tag keyring. It is hollow so that the
NFC chip can fit inside.


## [nfc_tag_sticker_keyring.stl](nfc_tag_sticker_keyring.stl)

This file is a variant of a NFC tag keyring above. This one is filled
inside. Instead the top part has been extruded so that a 25mm circular
NFC sticker can fit inside the 29mm wide circular recess.
